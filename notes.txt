signup endpoint is extremely simple just need to create a post endpoint and take
in a UserCreate input and store in the users table

login endpoint ma you need to also take in a post endpoint input and check
wether the given email or username exists in the databse, if so then check the
given password with the stored hashed password (stored during signup) and then
return a Token so that the frontend can store it in its local storage until it
expires or session ends.

creating the access token is as simple as importing jwt and using .enconde with
a HS256 algorithm and a predefined secret key. for the secret key i used openssl
rand -hex 32 on the terminal. also need to create a token schema beforehnd and
define the expiration.

the get user dependancy is as simple as taking the token from the frontend local
storage,

(this is done through a token dependany to go to my login endpoint and
get the token since the login endpoint is returning a token and the dependancy
will also check if the token is valid. use oauth for it.) 

running a jwt .decode on it to extract the "sub" attribute of the
token. in this case it would be the email, and then i just need to run the a db
search to find the user with said email and return it.
